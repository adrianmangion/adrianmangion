### <h1>Hi, I'm Adrian! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

My journey in coding began in 2014 when I was just 15 years old, ignited by the world of Java. As I delved deeper into this realm, it became clear that computing was where my true passion resided. In the following year, I was poised to sit for my computing O-level exam, a critical step toward my academic pursuits in this field. However, unforeseen circumstances derailed my plans, leading me to explore a different path. I embraced a period of focused studies in English, Maltese, and even embarked on a brief venture into first-year law studies.

It was during this period of exploration that I recognized my heart's true calling lay in the realm of computing. Reinvigorated and unwavering in my determination, I veered back onto the trajectory that had captured my imagination from the start. Eager to deepen my knowledge, I proactively enrolled in a private institution. Fast forward to today, and I stand proudly as a B.Sc. graduate in Computer Science and Systems Engineering with a distinction grade, having successfully navigated my academic journey.

With my degree in hand, I seamlessly transitioned into the professional world, where I have spent the last three years honing my skills and expertise. My work in the field has been immensely fulfilling, a testament to the unwavering passion that has guided my path. I find immense satisfaction in my role and take pride in contributing to the dynamic landscape of technology. As I continue to grow and thrive in my career, I remain committed to embracing innovation and driving progress in the ever-evolving world of computing.

<h2>Why do I code?</h2>

Coding, to me, is an art form that weaves creative and logical solutions into the fabric of challenges. It's akin to unraveling a puzzle, comprehending the intricacies of a problem, and methodically crafting a mosaic of smaller tasks that harmonize into a grand solution. The satisfaction derived from this process is unparalleled; it's like witnessing a masterpiece unfold, manifested as clean and purposeful code.

Stepping into the realm of professional coding over the past years has added an extra layer of significance. The act of creating code has transcended mere technicality; it's evolved into a means of crafting tailored solutions that bring tangible improvements to clients' endeavors. This newfound dimension infuses a deeper sense of fulfillment, as I contribute to the enhancement of their work and the quality of their outcomes.
