### <h1>Hi, I'm Adrian! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

I fell in love with coding back in 2014 as a 15-year-old tinkering with Java. That first taste of programming showed me exactly where my passion belonged. Though I was ready to take my computing O-level exam the following year, life had other plans for me. I ended up exploring different subjects - diving into English, Maltese, and even spending some time in first-year law studies.
But you can't fight what's meant to be. My heart kept pulling me back to computing, and I finally listened. I enrolled in a private institution to pursue my true calling, and today I'm proud to have graduated with distinction, holding a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Systems Engineering.
Since then, I've been putting my skills to work in the real world, growing and learning every day. What started as a teenage fascination has blossomed into a fulfilling career that constantly challenges and rewards me.

<h2>Why do I code?</h2>

For me, coding is where creativity meets logic. It's like solving a puzzle â€“ breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces, then watching them come together in elegant solutions. There's nothing quite like that moment when everything clicks and your code runs perfectly.
As a professional developer, I've discovered an even deeper satisfaction: creating solutions that make a real difference. Knowing my work helps clients achieve their goals and improve their operations adds purpose to every line of code I write.

Senior Developer at MeDirect, where I've been working since October 2023.
