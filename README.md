<h2>My Journey</h2>

I started coding back in 2014 using Java when I was 15 years old. A year later I was meant to sit for my computing oridinary-level exam which was meant to be the stepping stone towards the continuation of my studies in the domain. However, due to unseen circumstances I could not sit for the exam and thus ventured on a different path. One that involved studying English and Maltese at an advanced level and then sitting for a semester of law. 

I soon realized that law was never my calling and I turned back to what I remained passionate about, computing. I enrolled myself into a private institution, however I could not afford to do it full-time so I worked full-time and studied part-time until I could afford to study full-time. 6 years on from my first coding experience and here I am, currently sitting for my final year in Computer Science and System's Engineering. 

<h2>Why do I code?</h2>

Coding for me is a form of art. It encapsulates within it creative logical solutions which are unique to the way I reason out problems. It also gives me great pleasure to see clean code that serves a specific purpose. Throughout the past year of coding in a professional environment, I have also felt a greater sense of appreciation to offering solutions to clients who use them to enhance the quality of their work.

<h2>Current work</h2>
- Iâ€™m currently enrolled as a full-time student at Middlesex University (Malta) where my main focus is on my thesis titled 'Improving customer experience using sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews in the smartphone domain with consideration of fraudulent reviews'. <br/>
- I am also employed with a private company as a junior software developer. I worked 6 months full-time and have switched to part-time to focus on the final year of the degree.
