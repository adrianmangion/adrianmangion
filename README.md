<h2>My Journey</h2>

I started coding back in 2014 using Java when I was 15 years old. A year later I was meant to sit for my computing o-level exam which was meant to be the stepping stone towards the continuation of my studies in the domain. However, due to unseen circumstances I could not sit for the exam and thus ventured on a different path. One that involved studying English and Maltese at an advanced level and a semester of first year law. 

I soon realized that law wasn't my calling and I turned back to what I remained passionate about, computing. I enrolled myself into a private institution in which I am currently sitting for my final year of B.Sc. Computer Science and System's Engineering. 

<h2>Why do I code?</h2>

Coding for me is a form of art where the artist comes up with creative logical solutions to any problem given. It's a matter of understanding the problem and breaking it down into smaller tasks. It gives me great pleasure to see clean code that serves a specific purpose. Throughout the past year of coding in a professional environment, I have also felt a greater sense of appreciation to offering solutions to clients who use them to enhance the quality of their work.

<h2>Current work</h2>
- Iâ€™m currently employed with EML Payments, a fintech company, as a full-stack developer, where I deal with financial related queries.
- Tech stack: .NET, React, Mssql
