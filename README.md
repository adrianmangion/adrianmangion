<h2>My Journey</h2>

I remember as a little kid I used to sit down in front of my dads' switched off laptop and pretend to be coding for hours. I wasn't allowed to turn it on because he used it for work but that didn't stop me from enjoying the fruits of my imagination. I started coding back in 2014 using Java when I was 15 years old. A year later I was meant to sit for my Computing oridinary-level exam which was supposed to be a stepping stone towards the continuation of my studies in the domain. However, due to unseen circumstances I could not sit for the exam and thus ventured on a different path. One that involved studying English and Maltese at an advanced level and then sitting for a semester of law. 
Law was never my calling. Fast forward 6 years from my first coding experience and here I am, currently sitting for my final year of a 3-year degree in Computer Science and System's Engineering with a year of professional programming experience. 

<h2>Why do I code?</h2>

Coding for me is a form of art. Plain and simple. It encapsulates within it creative logical solutions which are unique to the way I reason out problems. It also gives me great pleasure to see clean code that serves a specific purpose. Throughout the past year of coding in a professional environment, I have also felt a greater sense of appreciation to offering solutions to clients.

<h2>Current work</h2>
- Iâ€™m currently enrolled as a full-time student at Middlesex University (Malta) where my main focus is on my thesis titled 'Improving customer experience using sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews in the smartphone domain with consideration of fraudulent reviews'. <br/>
- I also work part-time with a private comapny as a junior software developer.
